# DiamondPricePredictionApp

This project predicts **diamond prices** using a cleaned and feature-engineered version of the Kaggle dataset.  
The process includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning modeling**, and finally deploying the model as a **web application**.  

Users can input details such as **carat, cut, color, and clarity**, and instantly get a **predicted diamond price**.
